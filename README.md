### 1.2. Solution Profile  

#### 1.2.1. Background and Problem Statement  

###### Background
<p align="justify">
  In the current context, personal financial management has become a priority for many people who face economic challenges such as inflation, variable income and unexpected expenses. However, most people lack accessible, intuitive and effective tools to properly track their finances. Although there are applications on the market, many are complex, poorly customizable or do not offer active guidance to improve financial habits
</p>

###### Problem Statement (5Ws and 2Hs)

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">What: What's the problem?</h5>   

* Many people struggle to manage their income, control their expenses and plan their budgets, which prevents them from achieving their financial goals.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">Where: Where does the problem arise?</h5>  

* The problem arises in the daily lives of users, whether at home, at work, or during social activities, when they do not have adequate tools to make informed financial decisions.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">Why: Why can't they manage their finances well?</h5>  

* The lack of financial knowledge, the absence of personalized tools, and the use of disorganized methods lead to bad spending habits and insufficient savings.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">When: When does the problem occur?</h5>  

* The problem occurs in various situations: when making impulsive purchases, not monitoring periodic expenses, or not having clarity about the current state of their finances.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">Who/Quién: Who is involved?</h5>  

* People of different ages and socioeconomic levels, especially young professionals, families, and those with variable incomes.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">How: How do you manage your finances now?</h5>  

* Most people use rudimentary methods such as generic apps, spreadsheets or simply rely on their memory, which is inefficient and error-prone.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">How much: How much do they lose due to poor financial management?</h5>  

* It is estimated that, on average, people lose between 10% and 20% of their income due to unnecessary expenses, late payments and lack of planning

#### 1.2.2. Lean UX Process  

##### 1.2.2.1. Lean UX Problem Statements  
<p align="justify">
  The current state of personal financial management relies on disorganized and traditional methods such as spreadsheets, manual notes, or generic applications. These solutions do not provide efficient control or actionable information that allows users to improve their financial habits, resulting in financial losses, financial stress, and lack of savings.
</p>  

<p align="justify">
  The problem lies in the lack of an accessible and personalized tool that combines simplicity with advanced features, such as proactive alerts, savings suggestions and clear visualization of spending patterns. Users, especially young professionals and families, need a platform that integrates seamlessly into their daily routine and helps them make smart financial decisions.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Our product, SaveIt, will address this gap through an easy-to-use app that offers features such as automatic categorization, budget alerts, and interactive charts to help users monitor and optimize their finances.
</p>

<p align="jusify">
  We’ll know we’ve been successful when we see increasing adoption of the platform, with an increase in monthly retention rate and a customer satisfaction (CSAT) score above 90%.
